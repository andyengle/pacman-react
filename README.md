# Pacman character

Here's a simple implementation of the Pacman character (just the character only at this point!) built with React and some CSS.  It was written to show during a STEM talk to a third-grade class to show that writing code can be fun.

## Running

Do the usual:

First, `npm install` to get all the libraries needed to run, then `npm start` to make it come alive.

## Other details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Most importantly

Have fun with it!
